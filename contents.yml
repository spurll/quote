      No man is an island entire of itself; every man
      is a piece of the continent, a part of the main;
      if a clod be washed away by the sea, Europe
      is the less, as well as if a promontory were, as
      well as any manner of thy friends or of thine
      own were; any man's death diminishes me,
      because I am involved in mankind.
      And therefore never send to know for whom
      the bell tolls; it tolls for thee.

      all I hear is the wind slapping against the gravestones
      of those who did not make it, those who did not
      survive to see the confetti fall from the sky, those who

      did not live to watch the parade roll down the street.
      I have grown accustomed to a lifetime of aphorisms
      meant to assuage my fears, pithy sayings meant to

      convey that everything ends up fine in the end. There is no
      solace in rearranging language to make a different word
      tell the same lie. Sometimes the moral arc of the universe

      does not bend in a direction that will comfort us.
      Sometimes it bends in ways we don’t expect & there are
      people who fall off in the process. Please, dear reader,

      do not say I am hopeless, I believe there is a better future
      to fight for, I simply accept the possibility that I may not
      live to see it. I have grown weary of telling myself lies

      that I might one day begin to believe. We are not all left
      standing after the war has ended. Some of us have
      become ghosts by the time the dust has settled.

      Life is short, though I keep this from my children.
      Life is short, and I’ve shortened mine
      in a thousand delicious, ill-advised ways,
      a thousand deliciously ill-advised ways
      I’ll keep from my children. The world is at least
      fifty percent terrible, and that’s a conservative
      estimate, though I keep this from my children.
      For every bird there is a stone thrown at a bird.
      For every loved child, a child broken, bagged,
      sunk in a lake. Life is short and the world
      is at least half terrible, and for every kind
      stranger, there is one who would break you,
      though I keep this from my children. I am trying
      to sell them the world. Any decent realtor,
      walking you through a real shithole, chirps on
      about good bones: This place could be beautiful,
      right? You could make this place beautiful.

      It little profits that an idle king,
      By this still hearth, among these barren crags,
      Match'd with an aged wife, I mete and dole
      Unequal laws unto a savage race,
      That hoard, and sleep, and feed, and know not me.

      I cannot rest from travel: I will drink
      Life to the lees: All times I have enjoy'd
      Greatly, have suffer'd greatly, both with those
      That loved me, and alone, on shore, and when
      Thro' scudding drifts the rainy Hyades
      Vext the dim sea: I am become a name;
      For always roaming with a hungry heart
      Much have I seen and known; cities of men
      And manners, climates, councils, governments,
      Myself not least, but honour'd of them all;
      And drunk delight of battle with my peers,
      Far on the ringing plains of windy Troy.
      I am a part of all that I have met;
      Yet all experience is an arch wherethro'
      Gleams that untravell'd world whose margin fades
      For ever and forever when I move.
      How dull it is to pause, to make an end,
      To rust unburnish'd, not to shine in use!
      As tho' to breathe were life! Life piled on life
      Were all too little, and of one to me
      Little remains: but every hour is saved
      From that eternal silence, something more,
      A bringer of new things; and vile it were
      For some three suns to store and hoard myself,
      And this grey spirit yearning in desire
      To follow knowledge like a sinking star,
      Beyond the utmost bound of human thought.

          This is my son, mine own Telemachus,
      To whom I leave the sceptre and the isle,—
      Well-loved of me, discerning to fulfil
      This labour, by slow prudence to make mild
      A rugged people, and thro' soft degrees
      Subdue them to the useful and the good.
      Most blameless is he, centred in the sphere
      Of common duties, decent not to fail
      In offices of tenderness, and pay
      Meet adoration to my household gods,
      When I am gone. He works his work, I mine.

          There lies the port; the vessel puffs her sail:
      There gloom the dark, broad seas. My mariners,
      Souls that have toil'd, and wrought, and thought with me—
      That ever with a frolic welcome took
      The thunder and the sunshine, and opposed
      Free hearts, free foreheads—you and I are old;
      Old age hath yet his honour and his toil;
      Death closes all: but something ere the end,
      Some work of noble note, may yet be done,
      Not unbecoming men that strove with Gods.
      The lights begin to twinkle from the rocks:
      The long day wanes: the slow moon climbs: the deep
      Moans round with many voices. Come, my friends,
      'Tis not too late to seek a newer world.
      Push off, and sitting well in order smite
      The sounding furrows; for my purpose holds
      To sail beyond the sunset, and the baths
      Of all the western stars, until I die.
      It may be that the gulfs will wash us down:
      It may be we shall touch the Happy Isles,
      And see the great Achilles, whom we knew.
      Tho' much is taken, much abides; and tho'
      We are not now that strength which in old days
      Moved earth and heaven, that which we are, we are;
      One equal temper of heroic hearts,
      Made weak by time and fate, but strong in will
      To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield.

      Did gyre and gimble in the wabe;
      All mimsy were the borogoves,

      "Beware the Jabberwock, my son!
      The jaws that bite, the claws that catch!
      Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun
      The frumious Bandersnatch!"

      He took his vorpal sword in hand:
      Long time the manxome foe he sought—
      So rested he by the Tumtum tree,
      And stood awhile in thought.

      And as in uffish thought he stood,
      The Jabberwock, with eyes of flame,
      Came whiffling through the tulgey wood,
      And burbled as it came!

      One, two! One, two! and through and through
      The vorpal blade went snicker-snack!
      He left it dead, and with its head
      He went galumphing back.

      "And hast thou slain the Jabberwock?
      Come to my arms, my beamish boy!
      O frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!"
      He chortled in his joy.

    content: |-
      The world world was young, the mountains green,
      No stain yet on the Moon was seen,
      No words were laid on stream or stone,
      When Durin woke and walked alone.
      He named the nameless hills and dells;
      He drank from yet untasted wells;
      He stooped and looked in Mirrormere,
      And saw a crown of stars appear,
      As gems upon a silver thread,
      Above the shadow of his head.

      The world was fair, the mountains tall,
      In Elder Days before the fall
      Of mighty Kings in Nargothrond
      And Gondolin, who now beyond
      The Western Seas have passed away:
      The world was fair in Durin's Day.

      A king he was on carven throne
      In many-pillared halls of stone
      With golden roof and silver floor,
      And runes of power upon the door.
      The light of sun and star and moon
      In shining lamps of crystal hewn
      Undimmed by cloud or shade of night
      There shown forever far and bright.

      There hammer on the anvil smote,
      There chisel clove, and graver wrote;
      There forged was bladed and bound was hilt;
      The delver mined the mason built.
      There beryl, pearl, and opal pale
      And metal wrought like fishes' mail,
      Buckler and corslet, axe and sword,
      And shining spears were laid in horde.

      Unwearied then were Durin's folk;
      Beneath the mountains music woke:
      The harpers harped, the minstrels sang,
      And at the gates the trumpets rang.

      The world is grey, the mountains old,
      The forge's fire is ashen-cold;
      No harp is wrung, no hammer falls:
      The darkness dwells in Durin's halls;
      The shadow lies upon his tomb
      In Moria, in Khazad-dûm.
      But still the sunken stars appear
      In dark and windless Mirrormere;
      There lies his crown in water deep,
      Till Durin wakes again from sleep.
  - work: The Cremation of Sam McGee
    author: Robert Service
    content: |-
      There are strange things done in the midnight sun
          By the men who moil for gold;
      The Arctic trails have their secret tales
          That would make your blood run cold;
      The Northern Lights have seen queer sights,
          But the queerest they ever did see
      Was that night on the marge of Lake Lebarge
          I cremated Sam McGee.

      Now Sam McGee was from Tennessee, where the cotton blooms and blows.
      Why he left his home in the South to roam 'round the Pole, God only knows.
      He was always cold, but the land of gold seemed to hold him like a spell;
      Though he'd often say in his homely way that "he'd sooner live in hell."

      On a Christmas Day we were mushing our way over the Dawson trail.
      Talk of your cold! through the parka's fold it stabbed like a driven nail.
      If our eyes we'd close, then the lashes froze till sometimes we couldn't see;
      It wasn't much fun, but the only one to whimper was Sam McGee.

      And that very night, as we lay packed tight in our robes beneath the snow,
      And the dogs were fed, and the stars o'erhead were dancing heel and toe,
      He turned to me, and "Cap," says he, "I'll cash in this trip, I guess;
      And if I do, I'm asking that you won't refuse my last request."

      Well, he seemed so low that I couldn't say no; then he says with a sort of moan:
      "It's the cursèd cold, and it's got right hold till I'm chilled clean through to the bone.
      Yet 'tain't being dead—it's my awful dread of the icy grave that pains;
      So I want you to swear that, foul or fair, you'll cremate my last remains."

      A pal's last need is a thing to heed, so I swore I would not fail;
      And we started on at the streak of dawn; but God! he looked ghastly pale.
      He crouched on the sleigh, and he raved all day of his home in Tennessee;
      And before nightfall a corpse was all that was left of Sam McGee.

      There wasn't a breath in that land of death, and I hurried, horror-driven,
      With a corpse half hid that I couldn't get rid, because of a promise given;
      It was lashed to the sleigh, and it seemed to say: "You may tax your brawn and brains,
      But you promised true, and it's up to you to cremate those last remains."

      Now a promise made is a debt unpaid, and the trail has its own stern code.
      In the days to come, though my lips were dumb, in my heart how I cursed that load.
      In the long, long night, by the lone firelight, while the huskies, round in a ring,
      Howled out their woes to the homeless snows— O God! how I loathed the thing.

      And every day that quiet clay seemed to heavy and heavier grow;
      And on I went, though the dogs were spent and the grub was getting low;
      The trail was bad, and I felt half mad, but I swore I would not give in;
      And I'd often sing to the hateful thing, and it hearkened with a grin.

      Till I came to the marge of Lake Lebarge, and a derelict there lay;
      It was jammed in the ice, but I saw in a trice it was called the "Alice May."
      And I looked at it, and I thought a bit, and I looked at my frozen chum;
      Then "Here," said I, with a sudden cry, "is my cre-ma-tor-eum."

      Some planks I tore from the cabin floor, and I lit the boiler fire;
      Some coal I found that was lying around, and I heaped the fuel higher;
      The flames just soared, and the furnace roared—such a blaze you seldom see;
      And I burrowed a hole in the glowing coal, and I stuffed in Sam McGee.

      Then I made a hike, for I didn't like to hear him sizzle so;
      And the heavens scowled, and the huskies howled, and the wind began to blow.
      It was icy cold, but the hot sweat rolled down my cheeks, and I don't know why;
      And the greasy smoke in an inky cloak went streaking down the sky.

      I do not know how long in the snow I wrestled with grisly fear;
      But the stars came out and they danced about ere again I ventured near;
      I was sick with dread, but I bravely said: "I'll just take a peep inside.
      I guess he's cooked, and it's time I looked"; ... then the door I opened wide.

      And there sat Sam, looking cool and calm, in the heart of the furnace roar;
      And he wore a smile you could see a mile, and he said: "Please close that door.
      It's fine in here, but I greatly fear you'll let in the cold and storm—
      Since I left Plumtree, down in Tennessee, it's the first time I've been warm."

      There are strange things done in the midnight sun
          By the men who moil for gold;
      The Arctic trails have their secret tales
          That would make your blood run cold;
      The Northern Lights have seen queer sights,
          But the queerest they ever did see
      Was that night on the marge of Lake Lebarge
          I cremated Sam McGee.

      I met a traveller from an antique land
      Who said: Two vast and trunkless legs of stone
      Stand in the desart. Near them, on the sand,
      Half sunk, a shattered visage lies, whose frown,
      And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,
      Tell that its sculptor well those passions read
      Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,
      The hand that mocked them and the heart that fed:
      And on the pedestal these words appear:
      "My name is Ozymandias, king of kings:
      Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!"
      Nothing beside remains. Round the decay
      Of that colossal wreck, boundless and bare
      The lone and level sands stretch far away.
  - work: The Merry Inn Song
    author: J.R.R. Tolkien
    content: |-
      There is an inn, a merry old inn
      beneath an old grey hill,
      And there they brew a beer so brown
      That the Man in the Moon himself came down
      one night to drink his fill.

      The ostler has a tipsy cat
      that plays a five-stringed fiddle;
      And up and down he runs his bow,
      Now squeaking high, now purring low,
      now sawing in the middle.

      The landlord keeps a little dog
      that is mighty fond of jokes;
      When there's good cheer among the guests,
      He cocks an ear at all the jests
      and laughs until he chokes.

      They also keep a hornèd cow
      as proud as any queen;
      But music turns her head like ale,
      And makes her wave her tufted tail
      and dance upon the green.

      And O! the rows of silver dishes
      and the store of silver spoons!
      For Sunday there's a special pair,
      And these they polish up with care
      on Saturday afternoons.

      The Man in the Moon was drinking deep,
      and the cat began to wail;
      A dish and a spoon on the table danced,
      The cow in the garden madly pranced,
      and the little dog chased his tail.

      The Man in the Moon took another mug,
      and rolled beneath his chair;
      And there he dozed and dreamed of ale,
      Till in the sky the stars were pale,
      and dawn was in the air.

      Then the ostler said to his tipsy cat:
      "The white horses of the Moon,
      They neigh and champ their silver bits;
      But their master's been and drowned his wits,
      and the Sun'll be rising soon!"

      So the cat on his fiddle played hey-diddle-diddle,
      a jig that would wake the dead:
      He squeaked and sawed and quickened the tune,
      While the landlord shook the Man in the Moon:
      "It's after three!" he said.

      They rolled the Man slowly up the hill
      and bundled him into the Moon,
      While his horses galloped up in rear,
      And the cow came capering like a deer,
      and a dish ran up with the spoon.

      Now quicker the fiddle went deedle-dum-diddle;
      the dog began to roar,
      The cow and the horses stood on their heads;
      The guests all bounded from their beds
      and danced upon the floor.

      With a ping and a pang the fiddle-strings broke!
      the cow jumped over the Moon,
      And the little dog laughed to see such fun,
      And the Saturday dish went off at a run
      with the silver Sunday spoon.

      The round Moon rolled behind the hill,
      as the Sun raised up her head.
      She hardly believed her fiery eyes;
      For though it was day, to her surprise
      they all went back to bed.

      There will come soft rains and the smell of the ground,
      And swallows circling with their shimmering sound;

      And frogs in the pools, singing at night,
      And wild plum trees in tremulous white,

      Robins will wear their feathery fire,
      Whistling their whims on a low fence-wire;

      And not one will know of the war, not one
      Will care at last when it is done.

      Not one would mind, neither bird nor tree,
      If mankind perished utterly;

      And Spring herself, when she woke at dawn,
      Would scarcely know that we were gone.

      The up-top is where the bluebirds go

      If you need cross the street,
      Mind your shoes and mind your feet;
      For there are more to streets than horns that bleat
      Or cars that speed or lights that lead.
      There is something stranger yet
      That wants to take you: don't forget!

      Yes, there is something stranger still
      And if it can, it could and it would and it will.
      Its teeth are sharp, its eyes are sharp,
      Its voice a dulcet maze.
      So walk real quick and step real light
      And always look both ways!

      Look to the left to see your own death
      And look to the right to avoid a great fright
      And look for what hides under the cars that pass by,
      Under the trucks that speed,
      Under the pavement weeds,
      Under the asphalt and sand,
      Look for a quick grasping hand.

      Far over the misty mountains cold
      To dungeons deep and caverns old
      We must away ere break of day
      To seek the pale enchanted gold.

      The dwarves of yore made mighty spells,
      While hammers fell like ringing bells
      In places deep, where dark things sleep,
      In hollow halls beneath the fells.

      For ancient king and elvish lord
      There many a gleaming golden hoard
      They shaped and wrought, and light they caught
      To hide in gems on hilt of sword.

      On silver necklaces they strung
      The flowering stars, on crowns they hung
      The dragon-fire, in twisted wire
      They meshed the light of moon and sun.

      Far over the misty mountains cold
      To dungeons deep and caverns old
      We must away, ere break of day,
      To claim our long-forgotten gold.

      Goblets they carved there for themselves
      And harps of gold; where no man delves
      There lay they long, and many a song
      Was sung unheard by men or elves.

      The pines were roaring on the height,
      The winds were moaning in the night.
      The fire was red, it flaming spread;
      The trees like torches blazed with light.

      The bells were ringing in the dale
      And men they looked up with faces pale;
      The dragon's ire more fierce than fire
      Laid low their towers and houses frail.

      The mountain smoked beneath the moon;
      The dwarves they heard the tramp of doom.
      They fled their hall to dying fall
      Beneath his feet, beneath the moon.

      Far over the misty mountains grim
      To dungeons deep and caverns dim
      We must away, ere break of day,
      To win our harps and gold from him!

      didn't he make her obedient, so she'd do what her husband told her? Or if he hadn't

      "The foundation of morality is to have done, once and for all, with lying; to give
      up pretending to believe that for which there is no evidence, and repeating
      unintelligible propositions about things beyond the possibilities of knowledge."

      "The vast majority of all human effort, however great or minuscule, ends in failure.

      "I've come to believe and be persuaded that a lot of the elite helpfulness in our
      time is part of how we maintain the hoarding. We do giving in ways that protect
      the opportunity to keep taking. We make a difference in ways that protect the
      continued opportunity to make a killing. And we seek to change the world in ways
      carefully chosen to not change our world. When you look at the ways in which the
      winners of our age give back, help out, make a difference, they are often designed
      to protect the system, above all, that the winners stand on top of."

      "The concept of portraying evil and then destroying it—I know it is considered

      someone particular can be blamed for it, in life and in politics is hopeless."

      "The inferno of the living is not something that will be; if there is one, it is
      what is already here, the inferno where we live every day, that we form by being
      together. There are two ways to escape suffering it. The first is easy for many:
      accept the inferno and become such a part of it that you can no longer see it. The
      second is risky and demands constant vigilance and apprehension: seek and learn to
      recognize who and what, in the midst of the inferno, are not the inferno, then make
      them endure, give them space."

      "Power tends to corrupt and absolute power corrupts absolutely. Great men are almost
      always bad men, even when they exercise influence and not authority: still more when
      you superadd the tendency or the certainty of corruption by authority. There is no
      worse heresy than that the office sanctifies the holder of it."
